Welcome to the [AppSignal](https://appsignal.com) documentation!

In this documentation we aim to give you all the information you need to get
started, get the most out of the features and integrate your stuff with our
API.

We're continuously improving the documentation to make them as clear and useful
as possible. We'd love to get feedback on how we're doing, please let us know
at [support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com) if something is
unclear or if you have any suggestions.
