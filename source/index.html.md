Welcome to AppSignal. In this documentation we aim to give you all the
information you need to get started, get the most out of the features
and integrate your stuff with our API.

We're going to be working on these docs a lot to make them as clear and
useful as possible. We'd love to get feedback on how we're doing, please
let us know at [support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com) if
something is unclear or if you have any suggestions.
