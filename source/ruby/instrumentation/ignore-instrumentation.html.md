title: "Ignore instrumentation"
---

Sometimes you have very large background jobs that generate thousands of repeated queries over and over again. In these cases it might be a good idea to limit the amount of data you send to AppSignal. It's not that we can't handle these events, but generally your browser will have a very hard time to render the event tree for these jobs.

You "pause" the AppSignal gem from recording instrumentation in the following way:

```ruby
class BackgroundWorker
  def perform
    site = Site.find(1)
    10_000.times do
      Appsignal.without_instrumentation do
        site.do_stuff
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The code above will only instrument the `Site.find(1)` query and ignore all the queries generated by `do_stuff`.
