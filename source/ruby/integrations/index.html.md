AppSignal works with most popular Ruby frameworks and gems such as:

* [Capistrano](capistrano.html)
* [DataMapper](datamapper.html)
* [Delayed Job](delayed-job.html)
* [Grape](grape.html)
* [MongoDB](mongodb.html)
* [Padrino](padrino.html)
* [Rack](rack.html)
* [Rake](rake.html)
* [Resque](resque.html)
* [Ruby on Rails](rails.html)
* [Sequel](sequel.html)
* [Shoryuken](shoryuken.html)
* [Sidekiq](sidekiq.html)
* [Sinatra](sinatra.html)
* [Webmachine](webmachine.html)

We try to make most integrations work out-of-the-box, but some might require
some manual configuration steps.

It's always possible to integrate AppSignal manually in any system.

repository][examples-repo].
