## Ruby (MRI)

We currently support Ruby 1.9.3+ for the latest gem version `1.x`. To use this
version add to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'appsignal'
```

## jRuby

At the moment please install the `0.11` version of the appsignal gem if you use
jRuby. Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'appsignal', '~> 0.11.17'
```

We are working to support jRuby for the `1.x` release, but cannot provide an
ETA at this time.
