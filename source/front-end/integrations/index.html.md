## Integrations

An integration is a module that can consume the `Appsignal` object to catch errors from popular libraries or frameworks. These integrations may come in a variety of different forms, and we aim to generally provide APIs that are consistent, and feel idiomatic to use, with the libraries and/or frameworks that youâ€™re using.

These currently include:

- [React (beta) - `@appsignal/react`](/front-end/integrations/react.html)
