title: "AppSignal for JavaScript"
---

AppSignal has a first-class, solution for catching errors from front-end JavaScript applications and sending them to AppSignal. An `npm` library for catching JavaScript errors is available for all your front-end needs.

This is a __Beta__ implementation, which means:

* This feature is not yet available for all users.
* Although you should expect few changes, the API may change before public release.
