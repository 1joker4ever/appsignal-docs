## Linux and macOS

The AppSignal integrations for Ruby and Elixir contains native extensions and a
separate light-weight agent process. These native extensions are supported on
most Linux distributions and macOS.

### Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is not supported at this time because our agent, which written in
Rust, does not fully support Alpine Linux yet. This has been reported upstream
to the Rust team and they are working to improve support for Alpine Linux.
Please [let us know](mailto:support@appsignal.com) if you want to be included
in our trial for Alpine Linux when it becomes available.

## Microsoft Windows

We are undecided on supporting Windows. If you use Windows in your production
environment and would like us to support it, [send us an
e-mail](mailto:support@appsignal.com).
