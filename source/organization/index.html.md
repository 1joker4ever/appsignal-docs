title: "Organizations"
---

Let's say you have your own startup but still do some freelance work for
clients on the side. You'll want to have your own AppSignal billing setup for
your startup, while still being part of the AppSignal organizations of your
clients. This is easily done with "organizations" in AppSignal.

Organizations are basically umbrellas for your applications, which we charge on
the organization level.

## Create a new organization

Once you sign up for an AppSignal account you will need to create an
Organization, except when you accept an invitation to another organization.

If you already have an account you can [create a new
organization][profile-organizations] from your user account settings.

Because you'll probably work with new people and apps in this organization,
you'll start a new 30 day trial period for this new organization.

## Leaving an organization

In your user profile you can find a [list of all the
organizations][profile-organizations] you have access to. If you're not the
only owner of an organization you can leave it. Once you do that you will not
have access to the organization anymore, the only way to undo this is asking
the owner to invite you again.
