## Why was one of my charges declined?

There are a number of reasons for a declined charge. All banks have automated systems that decline or accept a charge. We've found that the most common reasons are:

* The card has expired, check the expiration date of the card to make sure it's not expired.
* The billing address does not match the address on the card, check if the billing address in AppSignal matches that on the card.
* The card has insufficient funds. If you use a pre-paid card, check if the card has sufficient funds to accept the charge. * Some cards have a monthly limit which has been reached. Let us know if this is the case, we can charge you at the beginning of next month and return to the normal billing cycle afterwards.
* A fluke in the matrix, sometimes the card gets declined at random with no specific reason. Contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@appsignal.com">contact@appsignal.com</a> and we'll figure this out together.
