To get your app running on AppSignal you start by clicking the "add app" link on the application overview page, or use this link to the ["add app" wizard for your organization](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/organization?to=sites/new).

In the wizard you will first be asked for what language you want to install AppSignal. We currently support Ruby and Elixir for error and performance monitoring, and JavaScript for front-end error monitoring.

After choosing a language you will be presented with instructions on how to install AppSignal in your app.

Once you deploy AppSignal will start receiving data and you're good to go!

## Installation instructions

Some language integrations and support for libraries require some manual steps to get set up. Please see our installation instructions for the language of your app for more information.
