## [Owners](#owners)

An owner has access to everything in your organization. Owners can
invite other users and can determine which other users get to be owner.

You can see the owners in the members screen. You can add change the role of users to member, owner or remove the user.

## [Teams](#teams)

If you want to give certain people in your organization access to a
limited set of your apps you can use teams.

Every user in your organization is a member of the "Everyone" team. You
cannot remove anybody from the Everyone team. Besides the Everyone team
you can create as many teams with specific members as you like. You can
specify which apps a team has access to.
