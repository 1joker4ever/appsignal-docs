Whenever you use AppSignal your log in with your user account. A user
can have access to one or more organizations that contain apps that are
being monitored.

## [Sign up](#log_in)
When you are invited to an existing account or sign up, you can choose to sign
up using Github or use an email / password combination.

## [Change personal settings](#change_your_personal_settings)
Once you're logged in you can navigate to your settings page by using
the settings link at the top right of the screen. There are four
personal setting screens.

### [Personal](#personal)

In personal settings you can change your name and password. If you
haven't linked your Github account during sign-up, you can still do so here.
Connecting your Github account gives you additional features like direct links
to commits and linked stacktrace lines

### [Notifications](#notifications)

You can have multiple email addresses associated with AppSignal.
This could be useful if someone invites you on your personal email address
while you prefer to use your company email address.

It's also useful if you are part of multiple organizations within AppSignal.
You can choose to have notifications sent to different email addresses per
organization.

You can configure which email address AppSignal should use for notifications
per organization. You can also choose whether you want to receive notifications
per app. If you disable notifications you'll still be able to access the app.

You can subscribe to weekly reports about your app and go into the details of
your notification settings for each site.

## [Organizations](#organizations)
Let's say you have your own startup but still do some freelance work for clients
on the side. You'll want to have your own AppSignal billing setup for your
startup, while still being part of the AppSignal organizations of your clients.
This is easily don with "organizations" in AppSignal. They are basically
umbrellas for your apps and the billing happens on the organization level.

### [Create a new organization](#create_organization)
You can start a new organization with the "new organization" button. Because
you'll probably work with new people and apps in this organziation, you'll have
a 30 day trial period again for this organization.

### [Leaving an organization](#leaving_an_organization)

In organizations you'll find a list of all the organizations you have
access to. If you're not the only owner of the organization you can
leave an organization. Once you do that you will not have access to the
organization anymore, the only way to undo this is asking the owner to
invite you again.
