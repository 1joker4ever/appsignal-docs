title: "Manage an app's settings"

All settings for an app can be found by clicking the App Settings link
in the main menu after you've navigated to an app.

## General

See [set up a new app](/getting-started/set-up-a-new-app.html) for more information about creating a new site.

If your app is not connected to a repository on GitHub you can connect
it. If it is connected you can change the linked repository. You need to authenticate
with GitHub to use this feature. You can either do this by signing in
via GitHub, or by linking your GitHub account in your [user
setttings](/getting-started/your-user-account.html). An app linked to GitHub gives you additional features like direct links to commits.

## [People](#people)

This screen gives you an overview of the teams and people that have
access to this app. You can change the permissions by editing a team,
you can read more about that in [Manage owners &
teams](/getting-started/manage-owners-teams.html).

At the moment we support multiple integrations, see [integrations](/getting-started/integrations.html) for more information.

## [Push/deploy](#push_deploy)

In this screen you can find your app's push key and some snippets to set
up deploy notifications.
